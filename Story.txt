Frank was an experienced thief, part of a Mafia heist crew in the city. They were tasked to steal a valuable stash of drugs under the cover of daylight so the cops wouldn't catch them.

Frank was the runner and he was chosen for his ability to slip away without leaving any trace. He knew the ropes and was one of the best in the biz. But he was nervous that the cops might pick up on his presence this time.

He ran out of the back door and into the bright sunlight. He had the drugs in his pockets and he needed to make a safe getaway. He darted through alleyways and backstreets, taking every turn he could to lose the police.

But soon enough, he heard sirens ringing in the distance. He had to get out of sight before the cops reached him. He ducked into an underground parking garage and hid amidst the shadows.

It seemed like an eternity, but eventually the police passed him by and faded into the distance. Frank glanced around and let out a sigh of relief. He'd made it without getting caught.

With a smile, he made his way back to his crew, the drugs in his pocket. He'd done it - he was one of the best thieves in the business and he'd proven it once again.
