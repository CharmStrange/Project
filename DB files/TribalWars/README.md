Tribal Wars (TW) is a browser-based, real-time strategy, massively multiplayer online game set in the Middle Ages. The game is set with each player starting off controlling a small village, with the objective being to slowly expand and conquer new villages through the formation of complex armies and a tactical combat system. The game incorporates multiple components of teamwork, planning, and strategy. The game allows players to collect resources, build armies, construct buildings, combat other armies (players or neutral), and conquer new villages. The game also allows for a level of player-specific customization, in regards to village names, army types, and troop-counts. The game operates under world-specific settings that vary from world to world.

# Head
I enjoyed playing Tribal Wars, which was developed by [InnoGames](https://www.innogames.com/). InnoGames provides some useful online tools for players, one of them is '[Tribal Wars Stats](https://www.twstats.com/)'. 

I examined HTML structure of 'Tribal Wars Stats' to crawl data. And wrote appropriate script, purpose was to generate / provide useful data files for players who are interested in player data / data analysis.

# Body
**Language** : **Python**

**Library** : **request**, **BeautifulSoup**, **sqlite3**

**Source Code** : [src.py](src.py)

**Database Folder** : [Click to move](Databases) / MM-DD-YYYY

# Tail
I announce this, not every file has same rows' length and size. Reason is, some of recorded players have no texts on website, but data. Source Code will delete them automatically.
